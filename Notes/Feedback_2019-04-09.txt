Hi Pri Items:
- [DONE] Notification for when it's your turn

Low Pri:
- Remember person's last name and other settings.
- When you receive rent, have pop up to show what you received from players
- Change 'End Turn' button color when you are out of actions
- Confirmation for discards
- Flip in hand should always be enabled
- Have log of events that are occurring so everyone knows what's going on
- When someone's renting you, have one row color for money and another for properties

- In rent window, give hint as to what the card is (i.e. thumbnail)
	- This is because it is important for rentee to know what color the property card he is giving is.
	
- Re-evaluate phrasing of JustSayNo dialog
	- People might accidentally click yes
	- Check if YesNo order is same on dialog
	- Maybe have confirmation

Bugs:
- Re-consolidate monopolies when rent is paid (minor, probably not worth fixing)
- Prevent discard after 7
    - This bug doesn't actually exist! (Already have a check for this)
- Player is not able to use 2 'Double the Rent' cards
